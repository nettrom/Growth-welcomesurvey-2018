    "# Welcome Survey Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "We aggregate Welcome Survey responses from all wikis where the survey is deployed and store the data in two tables in Hive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this notebook makes the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The MediaWiki database is the authoritative source of welcome survey data.\n",
    "2. We identify responses by when they were made, not when the user registered.\n",
    "3. Users have to have registered in the same month as we are aggregating for, or some time in the previous month.\n",
    "4. We use the ServerSideAccountCreation schema to identify whether the user registered on the desktop or mobile site. If the user is not found in this schema, they are assumed to have registered on the desktop site.\n",
    "5. Known test accounts from Growth Team members are not counted.\n",
    "6. We are measuring *responses* to the Welcome Survey, not how accounts were created. That means that a user who responded to the survey is assumed to have seen it and been able to respond to it in a normal way (i.e. through the normal account creation process).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Growth team expands coverage to more wikis, this notebook is set up to automatically discover and grab data from those wikis. This is done by getting the wiki configuration from WMFs servers and for each Wikipedia wiki checking if there's any Welcome Survey data stored in the database. If there is, the data gets processed and stored in the aggregate tables. Since this notebook is run once a month, this overhead of checking every Wikipedia isn't problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also coalesce the aggregate tables at the end of the data update into a single file directly through Spark. This is done in order to speed up subsequent queries of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FIXME\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the Growth features are on all the wikis, it would be a lot faster to search through `ServerSideAccountCreation` *once* and then reuse that dataset, rather than query that dataset for every wiki. This worked great when we were on few wikis, and was designed to work great under those conditions. Now those conditions changes, and we should update. We could also create a view of the last two months of registrations and cache that view, then query that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even with caching of ServerSideAccountCreation in Spark, we're still looking at about forty minutes of wall time to complete this. There's north of 200 wikis in the list, so that's around 10â€“12 seconds per wiki (which seems reasonable). I think having the caching is useful, but I also think it's important to change the timeout for the notebook to 2 hours."
